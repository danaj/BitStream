- documentation for text methods (add_code, code_get, code_put, ...)

- tests for invalid behavior
- tests for consistent die return strings

- Export

- XS code.  Really we want to either a speedup of vec routines,
  basically like Scalar::Vec::Util to add big-endian help, or
  go all out and write something that makes a SV string with all
  our methods supported.

CODES:

- m > 2 Fibonacci codes

- Omega ~0

- Ternary Comma

- Fenwick punctured codes

- Goldbach and Ulam additive codes.  Probably not efficient
  for anything large.

- Thoughts on Huffman, arithmetic
